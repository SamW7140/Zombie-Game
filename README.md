*   **Strategic Choices:** Make critical decisions that impact your survival.

*   **Character Progression:** (If applicable) Improve your character's skills and abilities over time.
*   **Multiple Endings:** (If applicable) Your choices determine your fate.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Make sure you have the JDK installed on your system. You can download it from [Oracle's website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).
*   **Integrated Development Environment (IDE):** While not strictly required, an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse is highly recommended for Java development.
*   **Git:** You will need git installed to clone the repository.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
    ```
    (Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME` with your actual GitHub details.)

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
    ```

3.  **Compile the Code:**
    ```bash
    javac src/*.java
    ```
    (If you have a more complex folder structure, adjust the command accordingly.)

4.  **Run the Game:**
    ```bash
    java Main
    ```
    (Replace `Main` with the name of your main class if it's different.)

### Running with an IDE

1.  Open the project in your chosen IDE.
2.  The IDE should automatically detect the Java source files.
3.  Locate the main class (the one with the `public static void main(String[] args)` method).
4.  Right-click on the main class and select "Run" or "Debug."

## Gameplay

*   **Objective:** Survive as long as possible against the zombie threat.
*   **Controls:** (Describe the controls here, e.g., text commands, GUI buttons, etc.)
*   **Tips:** (Provide some basic survival tips for new players.)
